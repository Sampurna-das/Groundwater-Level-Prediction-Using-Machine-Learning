# Groundwater-Level-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict groundwater levels using machine learning models based on historical and environmental data. By analyzing factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and water table fluctuations, the model provides accurate predictions to help in water resource management and sustainable groundwater usage.

Key Features:
âœ… Data-driven groundwater level prediction for informed decision-making
âœ… Machine Learning models (Regression, Time Series Forecasting)
âœ… Feature Engineering using rainfall, temperature, and historical water table data
âœ… Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score
âœ… Visualizations for groundwater trends over time

Technology Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LSTM for Time-Series)
ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis (Feature Selection, Preprocessing)

Potential Use Cases:
Water conservation planning for agriculture and urban areas
Government policies for sustainable groundwater management
Early warning systems for drought-prone regions
ðŸš€ Contributions & suggestions are welcome!
