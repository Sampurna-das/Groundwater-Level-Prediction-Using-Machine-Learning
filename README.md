# Groundwater-Level-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict groundwater levels using machine learning models based on historical and environmental data. By analyzing factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and water table fluctuations, the model provides accurate predictions to help in water resource management and sustainable groundwater usage.
